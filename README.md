The application is a community parks scavenger hunt.

We selected three large parks from Vancouver open data to use for our scavenger hunts. The app allows users to create an account and join/create hunts or view there collection within their profile. 

<b>Profile</b>

Displays a list of all the Artifacts that a user has collected through all of their hunts.

<b>Creating a Hunt</b>

When creating a hunt a player is opened to an activity which asks for a Hunt name and password. They can select one of the three parks using the map or the spinner. After they can use the slider to select how many Artifacts they want in the hunt. We currently have 10 spots to hide an artifact in each park so the max items is 10. After the desired amount is created, the artifacts can be edited from the list below. 

When selecting an artifact from the edit list, the user is brought to a new activity where they can name the artifact and choose a location to hide it using the spinner or selecting a marker on the map. 

When all the artifacts are completed the user can create the hunt.

<b>Joining/Playing a Hunt</b>

Users will see a list of all current hunts in the database. When one is selected they will either be prompted with a password dialogue or will be allowed into the game if no password was set for the hunt.

When inside a hunt the user will see a map with their current location and a list of artifacts to find in the hunt. The user can press the scan button in the corner of the map to scan around them for artifacts. Based on their distance from the artifact, the user will see a message telling them if they are close to one or not. As artifacts are found, they are removed from the list and added to the users collection.
